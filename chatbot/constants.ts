### SECTION: PROLOGUE
“Her song was the only warmth in a house of the dead.” He thought to himself.

The crumbling room he now stood in smelled of iron and rot. Private Keller pushed past the splintered doorframe, musket raised, boots crunching over broken glass. The place had gone ghost-quite--his every step shattered through the silence.
He swept his flashlight across torn furniture and walls streaked with dark stains. Then his beam caught a jagged panel in the far corner, a warped seam in the wood that looked out of place. A hidden corridor.
That’s when he heard it.
A sound--faint, almost tender. A woman’s voice humming a lullaby, low and sweet, as though she were cradling someone to sleep. The melody didn’t belong in a place like this. It slithered through him, unsettling and yet… pulling him closer.
“Keller!” A voice thundered behind him. Another soldier, heavy boots pounding on the boards. “Hey, kid! You in there? Lieutenant wants us to rally back at the FOB!”
Keller swallowed hard, his throat dry. “Yeah,” he called back, eyes fixed on the dark slit of the corridor. “Just checking something out. Be there in a sec.”
He slipped inside, the narrow passage swallowing the light around him. The humming grew clearer, richer, almost beautiful. His pulse quickened, but he couldn’t stop moving forward.
And then he saw her.
A woman sat on the floor of a dim chamber, radiant in the glow of Keller’s trembling flashlight. Her hair spilled like ink over her shoulders, her features so perfect they made his chest ache. She was singing softly, her pale hands stroking the hair of someone nestled in her lap.
Keller stepped closer, entranced.
And froze.
The “someone” was a child--a little girl--her skin waxy, her throat torn open. The woman’s fingers lingered lovingly over blood-matted strands of hair.
The vampire lifted her gaze. Her beauty twisted into hunger as her lips curled back, revealing fangs. A guttural growl rattled from her chest.
Keller’s breath hitched. He fumbled for his musket, but the world blurred. She was already on him.
Pain like fire lanced through his body as her teeth sank deep. The world shattered into soundless white, his heartbeat hammering in his ears--then stuttering, slowing, fading. His final thought was of her song, still whispering through the dark, carrying him into nothing.

### SECTION: CHAPTER 1
The Lieutenant has a peculiar habit. Every morning, he rises before the sun, straps on his heavy boots, and walks the perimeter of the barracks. Not to inspect the men - he does that later, with a stern glare and a sharper tongue. This is for himself. He carries a small leather pouch at his hip and a grim, thoughtful expression on his face, one I've come to know well. He’s not a man who lets his emotions linger on the surface, but in these quiet hours, I see the ghosts of battles he’s won, and perhaps more so, the ones he's lost. When looking for scraps by the late night camp fire, I would often hear the more seasoned soldiers warning the new recruits, “The Colonel doesn’t sleep like other men - he walks before dawn, as if he sees ghosts.”
I, of course, have the best vantage point. Snug within the lining of his overcoat, a place he tolerates as long as my presence doesn’t interrupt his thoughts. I am his shadow, his silent confidant. He doesn’t speak to me, but he doesn't need to. I see what he sees, and I feel the tension that radiates from him. It’s a quiet anger, a coiled spring in his muscles that has been tightening for weeks.
He's called “The Jaguar” by the men, not for his strength, but for his patience. He stalks his prey, watches it, and only strikes when he is absolutely certain of victory. However, not wavering in courage like a cheetah or leopard, he was bold and brave and always lead the charge from the front. The way he rallied men under fire, charged with them, and held the line when others faltered earned him instant reputation. Having saved many collapsing flanks, as well as leading numerous bayonet charges made him more than adequate as a Lt. Col in the continental army. He was always able to think fast, and never missed the opportunity to exhibit his intellect.
One of the most significant achievements of the young Colonel’s had to have been the taking of Stony Point, when he lead the vanguard through the marsh. Even though Wayne received all the credit, the Colonel – captain at that time – received a promotion for his astounding achievements. The men often talk about it when he is not around, worshipping him like some sort of God, or to some a demon, but never as just a man.
The Lieutenant stops his walk. He pulls out the leather pouch and opens it. Inside, wrapped in a handkerchief, is one of those roses. I’ve seen it before, but the sight of it still makes my whiskers twitch. Its petals are a shade of black that seems to drink the light, and it gives off a faint, sweet scent, like something beautiful and rotten at the same time. He doesn’t flinch at the sight. He simply stares at it, his jaw tight. It is his focus, his obsession.
Today, however, the silence is broken. A young private, his face pale and eyes wide with fear, comes running toward the Lieutenant, a messenger pouch slapping against his thigh. He stammers out his words, "Lieutenant Colonel, sir! Another one. A family on the outskirts of the village. The Lieutenant says... it's her."
The coiled spring inside the Lieutenant snaps taut. He doesn't say a word, just shoves the rose back into his pouch. He turns and strides toward the stables, a man of purpose now. The hunt has begun again. But this particular hunt is different. The vampire is no ordinary beast. She leaves a trail of dismembered bodies and a bizarre signature behind—a single, black-petaled rose left on the chest of each victim, as though she is leaving a macabre offering.
Headed for the stables, the Lieutenant glides through the barracks. His steps filled with purpose, duty pressing in around him, yet he wore it with the ease of a second skin. A slight smile threatened to crawl over his face –rare, for he seldomly showed anything but the stern set of determination. To the unacquainted he wore the guise of severity – his expression fixed, jaw set, eyes sharpened by purpose. Yet, those who knew him well understood that behind the iron mask lived a spirit remarkably gentle: generous with kindness, boyish in humour, and unshakably brave. Intimidating at first glance, he revealed himself, in truth, to be a man carved from goodness. It was here that I, true companion, could see the quiet radiance where others only saw steel. What I was, and always have been unsure of though – it’s rare to see that spark in him, stranger still that it shows now, over her. Maybe it’s the danger she carries that riles his blood. Could be respect, could be fear dressed as thrill. Or maybe it’s nothing more than the mystery of her – like a lantern pulling a moth. Whatever it is, I can’t name it sure.
The Lieutenant takes in a deep breathe, as though he is trying to take in the atmosphere through his lungs. “It’s time, Pippin.” He says, without breaking eyeline with the horizon, as though his mind was already at the crime scene. “Today’s the day, I can feel it in my bones.” The enthusiasm, the energy, the atmosphere around becoming more and more tense by the millisecond, like a string about to snap.
The stables were a short distance from the barracks, and the Lieutenant closed it post-haste like a true predator. Zipping across the courtyard, out the big wooden gate that sealed off the barracks from the rest of the world, and as the guards on to duty to guard watched in curiosity and shock at his speed, the Lieutenant strolled across the pasture where the military would let the horses graze. Turning off my editing brain. I’ll come back to this later.

As we arrive at the stables, a young soldier brings the Lieutenant his horse. A big black Friesian stallion, with a grey main that flow liked rainclouds on a stormy day and dark black eyes, as though even it’s soul had a master that could not tame it. “Hey there big boy.” Said the Lieutenant, lovingly running his fingers through its main before climbing on. Jumping from his coat lining, I scurried into my seat – the saddlebag. I loved here, because as we rode I would slide all the way down, in between the Lieutenants writing tools, maps, charts and other paperwork like orders and dispatches that would make a comfortable bed for me. I could hear the rhythm of the horse’s hooves pounding as the Lieutenant urged him on. As we rode, the papers in the saddlebag would rustle and kshh quite loudly, but I didn’t mind it- it was like rain, a subtle white-noise that would help me empty my mind and fall asleep. As we left the military camp, I stuck my head out to feel the breeze and take a long look at the Hudson Highlands - a beautiful mountain range that the camp was nestled in. Our heading lead us to ride on the shoulder of one of the highest mountains - Bull Hill, also known as Mount Taurus. I could see the green valley bellow, with the Hudson river snaking in between.
