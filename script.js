/* DELETED: legacy/duplicate script

   This file used to contain an older copy of the app logic and duplicated
   data (initialCharacters, initialPlotBeats). The canonical script is
   `app.js`. Keeping this file in the repo caused drift and introduced
   control-character artifacts in stored localStorage values.

   Purposefully cleared to avoid accidental loading. If you need an archive,
   create `archive/script-legacy.js` instead.
