# Writer's War-Room

A lightweight, oak-styled single page app to track plot beats, characters, and lore for your book project.

## Files
- `index.html` - main page
- `style.css` - oak aesthetic styles
- `script.js` - add cards and basic behavior

## Local usage
Open `index.html` in your browser. You can add Plot and Character cards using the buttons.

## Git
Repository initialized locally. To push to a remote GitHub repository, add a remote and run:

```powershell
git remote add origin <your-remote-url>
git push -u origin main
```

If you want me to create a remote repo and push, provide either your GitHub username (if you use an authenticated environment) or a remote URL.
